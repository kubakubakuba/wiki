# Programming basics

In this free time course, I will try to demonstrate the basics of programming. Why is it so interesting and what can be done with it.

I hope you will enjoy it.

The course draws from my experience, but is also largely inspired by the lectures and seminars I have attended at FEE CTU in Prague.

Here are some of the lectures and materials which you may find interesing:
